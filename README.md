Maven is a versatile build automation tool widely employed in Java projects. It facilitates the transformation of source code into deployable artifacts, particularly War files for web applications. Maven operates on the foundation of a Project Object Model (POM) file, delineating project structure, dependencies, and build instructions. Developers commence with writing source code, typically in languages like Java or C++, and proceed to compile it. Following compilation, unit testing is conducted locally to ensure code integrity. Upon successful testing, the code is packaged into various formats such as JAR or WAR files for Java projects, or ZIP files for Python projects. Subsequently, developers perform a health check, analyzing the code for bugs and vulnerabilities. Maven is commonly integrated with Jenkins for automated build processes, leveraging Maven plugins to streamline artifact generation. Alternatively, developers can manually build the source code using Maven, installing it on an EC2 instance within an AWS environment. For instance, launching an EC2 instance running Ubuntu distribution allows for manual source code building with Maven.
